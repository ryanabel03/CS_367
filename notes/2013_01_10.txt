Points vs Vectors
--------------------

  Point
    * geometric object that describes a location

  Vector
    * geometric object that describes motion (direction) of two points
    * Not attached to any location -- vectors are translation-invariant 

  Space: An infinite set of something


--------------------
Vector space
--------------------

  An inifinte set of vectors with two operations 
    * Addition of two vectors
    * Scalar multiplication of vectors

  Distributive Property
    * a(u + v) = au + av
     -- where a is a scalar and u and v are vectors


--------------------
Affine space
--------------------

  A vector space with an infinite set of points and a subtraction operation

  Subtraction
    * Subtract two points, result is a vector
    * B - A = u   OR    head - tail = u
      -- where B and A are points and u is a vector
    
  Adding a vector to a point
    * Get another point


--------------------
Euclidean space
--------------------

  A vector space with an inner product of two vectors (DOT PRODUCT)

  Inner product
    * product of two vectors, result is a scalar
    * < a, b >
      -- where a and b are vectors
    * Allows measurement of distance and angle

  Derived operations
    * Length of a vector
      -- |a| = sqrt(<a, a>)

    * Distance between two points
      -- x = P - Q    OR    x = Q - P
      -- where P and Q are points and x is a vector
      -- distance(P, Q) = |x|
    
    * Angle between 2 vectors
      -- /_ (a, b) = arc cos ( <a, b> / (|a| |b|) )
