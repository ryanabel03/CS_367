This example shows how to maintain a separate coordinate frame (4x4 matrix)
for each 3D object. Using this CF, all transformations to an object can
be implemented by multiplying the CF with a new transformation.

* Post-multiplying an operation M with CF

      CF * M

  transforms the CF with respect to its own CF

* Pre-multiplying an operation M with CF

     M * CF

  transforms the CF with respect to the global coordinate frame

Compilation Instructions
========================
The matrix, vector, and quaternion operations in this example are
implemented using the OpenGL Mathematics library found at
http://glm.g-truc.net. 

The API page of the GLM library is at http://glm.g-truc.net/api-0.9.4
The source code of this library can be cloned from
https://github.com/g-truc/glm.
