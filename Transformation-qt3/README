This program allows you to interactively specify a series of OpenGL
transformation and observe their effect to the object (letter D)
originaly placed at the origin of the world coordinate.

The "Step" button allows you to observe the step-by-step effect of the
transformations while they are interpreted in backword / forward order. 

Use the "Reset" button to reset the transformation to "no op".

The GUI of this program is designed using the Qt-Designer. The myForm.ui output
generated by the Qt-Designer is then used by the uic (User Interface
Compiler) program for generating myForm.h and myForm.cpp files where the
class MyForm is defined. The GUI class then uses a subclassing technique
to implement the slots.
