OVERVIEW
This example shows an animation of a wheel at the tip of two arms.
The wheel rotates on its own axis while the arms themselves swing like a 
pendulum.

By maintaining separate coordinate frames for each object (one for the arms
and for the wheel), a composite transformation can be easily calculated.
