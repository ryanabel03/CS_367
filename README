Most of the examples are configured using cmake (downloadable from
cmake.org). Cmake can generate Makefile/project files for many different
IDEs/platforms:
- Unix Makefile
- Codeblock
- Eclipse
- KDevelop
- Xcode
- Eclipse
- [and much more]

Additional tools needed to compile:
1) GLUT header files, downloadable from 
   http://user.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html
2) C++ compiler: g++ or Visual C++ Express

On Linux, use the freeglut3-dev package.
On Windows, follow the instruction found at one of the following sites:
     http://user.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html
     http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/

INSTRUCTIONS
============
The following commands must be entered after you chdir to each of the
example subdirectory so that the "build" subdirectory is created as a
sibling to the "src" subdirectory.

To compile using command-line make (Linux/MacOS X)
(1) mkdir build
(2) cd build
(3) cmake ../src    # to generate Unix Makefile
(4) make

To compile using Eclipse (Linux/MacOS X)
(1) mkdir build
(2) cd build
(3) cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefile" ../src  # generate an Eclipse project
(4) Use Eclipse to import the project under the build subdirectory

To compile using Xcode (MacOS X)
(1) mkdir build
(2) cd build
(3) cmake -GXcode ../src
(4) Open the Xcode project file generated in the build subdirectory
    Under the "Product" menu, Select "Manage Schemes" and disable the
    "ALL_BUILD" and "ZERO_CHECK" targets

To compile on Windows (Visual Studio)
(1) mkdir build
(2) cd build
(3) cmake ../src
(4) Open the generated VS project
